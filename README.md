# Welcome to SuperPy!

SuperPy is a command-line-tool built in Python, that is able to keep track of the storage of a supermarket. The core functionality of the program is keeping track of and producing reports on various kinds of data. The program shows which products the supermarket offers, how many of each product it has available, how much each product was bought and sold for, and what the product's expiration date is, which date it was bought and which date it was sold, and if it has expired, the date when it did. The program is able to register bought and sold items, produce reports about revenue, profit, and loss on various kinds of conditions, and last, but not least, it is also able to export selections of data into csv or excel files.

The following modules and libraries were used to build this command-line-tool:

    - CSV -- https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
    - pandas -- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide
    - datetime -- https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
    - argparse -- https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
    - rich -- https://github.com/Textualize/rich

Start:

    Please download the following files and place them in the SAME folder on your computer! 
        - bought.py
        - date.py
        - export.py
        - loss.py
        - main.py
        - print.py

When you start to use the program, make sure you have the desired date saved in the file. You can update this directly from the date.txt file or from the commandline as well. You also have to make sure that the date is correct if you want to register a bought or sold product since the program is going to set the buy_date and sell_date from the date.txt file by default. If you skip this step, the products might be registered with the wrong information, and you will have to manually remove them from the data files.

First, you have to start the command-line-tool from the terminal and write the desired command behind it as follows: 
    
    python main.py command (-argument(s) (if present))
        or
    py main.py command (-argument(s) (if present))

Command usage with examples:
1. Date commands:
    1. date, date-and-time:

        - While the date command is going to return the current date, the date-and-time command is going to return the exact time.
        - It provides information only.
            - Example: py main.py date  --> Today's date is: 2023-06-26
            - Example: py main.py date-and-time --> Today's date and time is: 2023-06-26 20:23:27.646851

    2. checkpoint

        - To control if the right date is set in the date.txt file, use the following command.
            - Example: py main.py checkpoint --> The current date in 'date.txt' file is 2023-06-24

    3. set-current-date, set-date-manually

        - To set the current date, use the following command.
            - Example: py main.py set-current-date --> Date is set to: 2023-06-26
        - To set the date manually, you have to pass the date as an argument (-d/--date) to the function. Set the date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD!
            - Example: py main.py set-date-manually -d 2023-06-25 --> Date is set to: 2023-06-25

    4. advance-date-forwards, advance-date-backwards

        - The program is able to advance the date forward or backward based on the number of days given as an argument (-d/--date). It must be a number. You can never advance the date to a future date!
            - Example: py main.py advance-date-forwards -d 1 --> Date is set to: 2023-06-26
            - Example: py main.py advance-date-backwards -d 10 --> Date is set to: 2023-06-16

2. Register commands:    
    1. register-bought
        - To register a new product, always check first with the checkpoint command if the date is set correctly in the date.txt file; if not, adjust it.
        - The command takes in four arguments. These arguments always have to follow in this order: -pn/--productname (string) -p/--price (float) -a/--amount (integer) -ed/--expirationdate (YYY-MM-DD)
            - Example: py main.py register-bought -pn cola -p 1.99 -a 10 -ed 2024-01-01 
            - Output: You have registered as bought product: 10 cola which cost 1.99 euros each, bought on 2023-06-16 and it is going to expire on 2024-01-01.
    2. register-sold
        - To register a sold product, always check first with the checkpoint command if the date is set correctly in the date.txt file; if not, adjust it.
        - The command takes in four arguments. These arguments always have to follow in this order: -pn/--productname (string) -a/--amount (integer) -p/--price (float)  -ed/--expirationdate (YYY-MM-DD)
        - The expiration date always has to match the date given for the expiration date when the product was bought!
            - Example: py main.py register-sold -pn cola -a 10 -p 1.99 -ed 2024-01-01 
            - Output: You have registered as a sold product: 10 cola, sold for 1.99 euros each on 2023-06-16.
3. Reports:    
    1. storage, bought, sold, expired
        - These commands return a list of the currently available storage, a list of all bought and sold products, and a list of expired products.
        - Example:
            - py main.py storage
            - py main.py bought
            - py main.py sold
            - py main.py expired
    2. product & amount
        - If you want to know if a specific product is available or not, you can pass the name of the product to this command as an argument (-n/--name), and it will return all available products with that name in a table.
        - Example: py main.py product -n cola --> Returns a table
        - If you want to know exactly how many of that product are available, you can pass the product name as an argument (-n/--name) to the amount command and it will return the exact amount that is available for sale.
        - Example: py main.py amount -n cola --> You have 70 available cola for sale!
